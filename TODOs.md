# TODO List

- Add transition animations while navigating
- Add unit testing, specially for services
- Use some environmental variable (such as dotenv) to extend services using the GitHub Api token authentication
- Extend functionality adding:
    -- Login/logout screens
    -- Maybe a CRUD system for storing 'favorite' users or repos (making use of Akita for storage)
    -- GitHub link to access repo and user information
    -- Update the loading layer, making it a component and managing it with a service
    -- Use array/object destructuring assingment to beautify service code
